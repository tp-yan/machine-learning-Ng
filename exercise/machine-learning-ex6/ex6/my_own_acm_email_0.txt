Dear Tang Peng,
We’ve noticed that you haven’t renewed your membership in awhile, and we’d like to remind you of the many benefits ACM offers our Student Members and introduce you to some new ones you may not be aware of:

Our online Learning Center offers books, courses, videos and other tools to help you advance in your academic development. It now includes Learning Webinars featuring well-known speakers on the hottest topics in computing.

Our Career & Job Center helps you prepare for a career in computing with résumé posting, advice, and alert services, while CareerNews is a twice-monthly digest of articles on career-related topics.

Communications of the ACM, ACM’s flagship magazine on global computing trends, now includes lively blog discussions and practice articles from the ACM Queue online magazine. XRDS, ACM’s magazine for students, will keep you informed on current advances and issues in computing and related fields.

Don’t lose these valuable member benefits — rejoin ACM today

I look forward to welcoming you back to ACM as an active member!

Sincerely,

Cindy Ryan
Associate Director of Membership
